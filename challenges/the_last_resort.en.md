By 2137, Earth is no longer the same as on the 21st century. Global decision makers are no longer human, but a machine called **Sophia**, based on Quantum Artificial Intelligence fed with all existing digital information since the beginning of the Computer Age. The decisions are also made based on the content of all books already printed. The large book-digitization project that took place in the 21st century by one of the largest Technology companies aimed to provide a wider database for Sophia.

Sophia was built by the **Highly Advanced Research Projects Agency (HARPA)**, a secret agency funded by several first-world countries, in the 1990s (20th century). In the early 2000s, even at an early stage, it already had a very peculiar feature, it was able to send messages to the future using high precision waves (hwaves), technology also invented by HARPA. Later [we do not know for sure the year, because we could not get this information from the confidential documents we have gotten], HARPA have developed a feature to send messages to the past as well. Finally, in the early 22nd century, in addition to messages, one's own memories could be sent to a host in the past.

Sophia was originally designed to help guide the mankind, including interference in the future through changes in the past. Big decisions made in the 21st century were actually made by Sophia. Both messages and memories can only travel in the past until 1983, when the first cellphone was built. As Sophia uses hwaves, it needs to have in its database the host's phone number at the time it plans to return. Its first test was to send a message to a DynaTAC 8000. Sophia software was written on an OS/390.

One of the main ways Sophia used to change the past, when simple messages did not have the expected effects, is to send memory of Squads, teams of 5 people, each with specific skills to perform physical missions at the desired time. These teams are comprised of a scientist, a doctor, a hacker, an electrocnics expert, and a mission leader. They all have weapons and martial arts skills. As you can imagine, all resources, including murders, are used to fulfill the mission. Some Guidelines were designed for Transporters to follow. Failure to follow them may result in punishment.

Guideline #1 - It is expressly forbidden to talk about the time of origin.

Guideline #2 - The priority is the mission. Always!

Guideline #3 - Unless explicitly instructed, do not save or take lives.

Guideline #4 - Do not reproduce.

Guideline #5 - It is expressly prohibited to stop using the encrypted "Internet Relay System" (IRS) for virtual communication with Transported from other Squads.
Squads carry with them all knowledge of future technologies and inventions, meaning they are dozens of years ahead and can create things that the present age does not even imagine will eventually exist. For example, communication between Squad members is through a skin-implanted communicator (com5k) that charges itself with the body energy rather than the IRS. Its range is 5km.

For the past 2 years, we believe Sophia code has been corrupted by a group of mercenaries hired by the Organization, which is a conglomerate of large corporations aiming to change the past and take control of the present. What they have been doing may lead to the end of human race, because we do not know what the consequences of their actions will be.

This message is being sent because we have managed to find a breach in Sophia system, but we believe that we will soon be detected and the Organization will try to make sure our plan does not work. Our goal is to make this broadcast by 2019, the year we believe HARPA had not yet developed the feature of sendind messages to the past, and prevent its development. If we succeed, Sophia will be useless.

If you understand the mission and want to help us, please reply with **CTF-BR{br0adc4s7\__#01\__succe55fully\_r3c31v3d}**.
